# lanyard

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of lanyard is to provide goodness-of-fit tests as [yardstick](https://yardstick.tidymodels.org/) metrics.

## Installation

You can install the development version of lanyard like so:

``` r
# Install from github
pak::pkg_install("leonfernandes/lanyard")
```

## Example

As an example, you can calculate the autocovariance/autocorrelation using the `acf_metric` function.

```{r demo}
library(lanyard)
data <- data.frame(t = rnorm(100), e = rnorm(100)) # simulate data
acf_metric(data, t, e) # get acf
```
